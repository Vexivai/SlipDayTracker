# SlipDayTool 

This tool helps the TAs track the active students they have in their roster. 
I have a Tutorial.pdf to reference in the files. 

I took the CSV download approach instead of trying to go through the SSO 
sign in approach. Otherwise I would have had to have each user set up their 
own sign in privileges, and scrape and create each detail manually. By the 
time I would have gotten any closer to that goal, I would have graduated..

~ Shortcuts ~ 
Delete   : toggle student’s drop status
[        :                 use slip day
]        :              refund slip day 
Enter    :                    edit note
Hold esc :                save and exit

Known Bug: 
  After initializing the first time, sometimes a 
  "Display N possibilities (y/ n)?" pops up. 

  ... You can go ahead and hit n for that. 

As a disclaimer: 
I personally made sure to scrub the repo and its caches 
of all potentially cached student ids &| information by cleaning the commit history.
